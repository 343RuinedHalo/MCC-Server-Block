# MCC Server Block

Block laggy servers that host game matches in Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PC (or Xbox One if you're using a bridged connection through your PC to connect your Xbox One to the internet). Makes your MCC experience *slightly* better, for whatever its worth.

Select the servers you don't want to play on and click apply changes. If you're running the game then refresh the server list under Settings > Network after you've updated your blocked servers selection and before you search for your next match.

This application updates the Windows 'hosts' file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) and must be ran as administrator to be able to access and update the hosts file

This application supports remotely updating the local server list file to keep on top of changes made to the game server addresses (they change the IP addresses sometimes). If a server you were previously blocking becomes accessible in-game again then try updating the server list file.
